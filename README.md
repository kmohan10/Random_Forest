# Random_Forest
Random Forest is a Supervised Machine Learning model that can be used for both Regression and Classification problems. It is also considered as Ensemble Learning since Random Forest involves building multiple individual Decision Trees and consolidating their outputs to give the final prediction.

Some of the Key parameters that need to be determined while constructing a Random Forest model are:

k - The number of Features that should be Randomly selected to construct each Decision Tree
m - Total number of Features in the dataset
n - Number of individual Decision Trees
For this example, we will be using a dataset 'car_evaluation.csv' sourced from Kaggle. (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Felikplim%2Fcar-evaluation-data-set)

Would also like to acknowledge that some of the code flow is sourced from Random Forest Classifier Tutorial by Prashant Banerjee on Kaggle website. (https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaggle.com%2Fdatasets%2Felikplim%2Fcar-evaluation-data-set)
